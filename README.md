# The Carpentries Code of Conduct 
## Reporting Guidelines and Enforcement Guidelines Task Force Charter

__Context__  
In the last year, incidents surrounding [The Carpentries Code of Conduct (CoC)](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html) highlighted issues with enforcing the CoC and adjudicating reported CoC violations. As a result, and due to multiple Lesson Programs (Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry and Library Carpentry) becoming The Carpentries, there have been updates to governance and policy documents, including [updates to the Code of Conduct](https://carpentries.org/blog/2018/09/coc-revision-release/).

Updates to the CoC were segmented in three parts: 1) The Carpentries Code of Conduct, 2) Incident Reporting Guidelines, and 3) Enforcement Manual. The process of updating 1) and 2) took five months (from April 2018 through September 2018)

Since completion of the CoC update, there have been two CoC incidents reported.

* __Incident #1:__ Reported 2018-09-07, Resolved 2018-10-17 
* __Incident #2:__ Reported 2018-09-27, Resolved 2018-10-19

For more information, see the [Code of Conduct Transparency Report](https://github.com/carpentries/executive-council-info/blob/master/code-of-conduct-transparency-reports/2018-11-09-coc-transparency-report.md).

These two incidents were assessed under the current enforcement manual, which prevented the committee from arriving at a resolution swiftly. The Executive Council has expressed concern with the lack of timeliness as it relates to resolving CoC incident reports. The CoC Committee serves to respond and resolve CoC incident reports, and update documentation. Though work has been completed to update our Code of Conduct, the CoC committee could use additional expertise to update the reporting guidelines and enforcement manual. Such updates include, but are not limited to: 

* Receiving a report (via a secure form)
* Handling a report (in terms of data storage, meetings, etc.)
* Resolving a report
* Communicating about incidents

__Objectives__  
The objective of this task force is to update our Reporting Guidelines and Enforcement Manual and Guidelines and processes. We want all members of our community to understand the process, for reporters to feel safe and supported in reporting an incident and in the community, to ensure a confidential process, and for people under review to have access to a fair and unbiased review. We want to be able to handle Code of Conduct reports respectfully, in a timely manner and with appropriate communication and transparency in accordance with our Code of Conduct. A draft lists of tasks to meet our objective is as follows:

1. Identify practices of organizations similar to The Carpentries for reviewing, responding to, and enforcing CoC violations.

3. Update the Reporting Guidelines to include a secure collection method.
